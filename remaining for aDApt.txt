lost and found - edit functionalities not working properly (give qanda manager and say that do it like this)
qna manager 
shared resource - do this temporarily
(do it all again)

email should only be edited and deleted by admin

auth middleware

cloudinary url not working



//new
1. here what is happening is i have set an admin key in env varibles so if the admin key matches that then only the member becomes admin or else even though i add the admin key i would be a normal memeber only.
2. email api not working - add and fetch and almost all the apis(some auth problem)
3. edit and delete in emails is coming also if the member is normal so along with input box and add email button do conditional rendering on that too.
4. run git status to see the remaining conflict and solve that manually
