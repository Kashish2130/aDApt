# aDApt_NODE_Project

### I made the entire front end from scratch by learning REACT.js side by side.

## Things i learnt :

1. Authentication using JWT (login-signup)
2. REST APIS (CRUD operations)
3. Node.js (Handles routes, controllers, and API logic)
4. MongoDB (Defining schemas and models to structure my database)
