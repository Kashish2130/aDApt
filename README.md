# aDApt_NODE_Project

### I made the entire front-end from scratch by learning REACT.js side by side.

## Things i learnt :
### Before MID Evaluation (22nd Jan) :
1. Authentication using JWT (login-signup)
2. REST APIS (CRUD operations)
3. Node.js (Handles routes, controllers, and API logic)
4. MongoDB (Defining schemas and models to structure my database)

## After MID Evaluation - No major changes! 
### Added
1. auth middleware
2. auth context
3. admin key working properly
4. UI for - LnF, SRL, QnA pages
